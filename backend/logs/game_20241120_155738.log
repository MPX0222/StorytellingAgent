I... I don't know. Things have been really strange lately. I just... I don't know what to do.

Message: *looks around nervously, then steps closer to you, lowering his voice*

I know it sounds crazy, but... every morning, I wake up at exactly 6:00 AM. The same day, the same routine. I've tried everything to break free, but nothing works. It's like I'm stuck in this endless loop, and I don't know why.

*pauses, searching your face for any sign of understanding*

Do you... do you believe me?

You... you believe me? After everything I've been through, it's hard to trust anyone. But if you really are my best friend, maybe... maybe there's a chance we can figure this out together.

*takes a deep breath, feeling a bit more at ease*

I don't know what's causing this loop, but I have a feeling it has something to do with the exams. The pressure, the stress... it's all too much. Maybe if we can find a way to understand what's happening, we can break free from this nightmare.
